Hello, this was my first submission for the DevChallenges and I think it came out pretty good.
At thirst I struggled how to upload and save the Images from the Users but then I used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) with made things a lot easier.

You can see my finished Project here: [Image Uploader](https://image-upload-lucas.netlify.app/)
